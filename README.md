# Aquifer recharge with PR method

The first step to applying the SCS method is the Curve Number (CN) calculation. In this example, the Land Cover Classification project (https://mapbiomas.org/) and the Soil Grid (250 m) (see how to download here: https://github.com/lvsantarosa/Soil-Grid-on-Google-Earth-Engine) soil texture maps were used to generate a spatial CN using the `terra` package. The complete SCS Method is available in the documents of USDA (https://nationalstormwater.com/urban-hydrology-for-small-watersheds-tr-55/)

With the CN the daily riunoff is calculated to produce a water budgest (PR = P - (ETP + Roff)), the precipitation is from GPM and the evapotranpiration is from GLDAS 2.1 

### The following paper was written using this method:
